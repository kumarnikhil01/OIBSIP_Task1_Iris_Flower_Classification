# OIBSIP_Task1_Iris_Flower_Classification

Training the machine so that it can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

There are 2 models created by me using 2 approaches :-
 1. Using SVM
 2. Using Logistic Regression
